This is a simple recipe website including simple recipes for authentic gulyas (goulash) as well as a few other recipes.

This project is a simple first project so that i can familiarize myself with html, css, and the tools I use to access them such as VS code and Git. this is my first actual project in the world of full stack web development and prepares me with essential skills for a career in web development. These skills include git, html, css, using the terminal as well as good commits and web design.
