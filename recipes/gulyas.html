        <h3>Hungarian goulash is not american goulash</h3>
        <p>Goulash is Hungary's national dish, yet very few actually know what it is.
            The dish many know to be goulash is actually known in hungary as pörkölt. 
            This recipe teaches the gulyásleves many hungarians (including me) 
            know and love. While the american goulash is a stew involving macaroni, 
            beef and tomato paste, the hungarian goulash is a soup involving beef,
            a variety of vegetables, paprika and a small amount of white wine.
            It was traditionally cooked by herdsmen in a large pot, and you can still 
            find this style of cooking today. Due to this simple herdsman ancestry,
             the goulash is an outstanding example of what incredible 
            flavor can be produced by simple ingredients when cooked properly.
